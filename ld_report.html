    <p>I feel like I didn't manage my team very well. I didn't get them the information they needed in a timely manner. I also didn't communicate with them effectively.</p>
    <p>I communicated with my client as needed when I had questions or needed update him on the project. There were no issues with the communication after we set up how we wanted to communicate with each other.</p>
    <p>I have reached out to my client with the link to his website. I havent gotten a response from him yet but other than that there were no issues with sharing it with him.</p>
    <p>My expeience with managing my site with github was overall positive. I was a bit of a learning curve for me at first since I hadnt used it prior to this class</p>
    <p>The link to my website is: <a href="https://braydendawson.github.io/wdd130-madsen/">https://braydendawson.github.io/wdd130-madsen/</a></p>
