    <p>I communicated with my team leads through email. The only issue I ran into was I could not get in contact with one of my lead developers.</p>
    <p>My lead developer made the site plan accessible to me so I had access to the wireframes and the site content. So overall the lead developer made it clear what was expected</p>
    <p>I was able to contribute to the site</p>
    <p>I did not run into any issues with github with adding my changes to the site</p>
    <p>The link to my website is: <a href="https://braydendawson.github.io/wdd130-he/">https://braydendawson.github.io/wdd130-he/</a></p>
