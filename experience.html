    <p>The most challenging part of this project was communicating with my client, Junior Developers and Lead Developers. I was able to overcome it and work with all of them to complete the project</p>
    <p>The part of this project I enjoyed the most was being able to make a website for a client based off of what they wanted their site to look like</p>
    <p>Something I would do differently is not procrastinate things and do things in a timely manner</p>
    <p>Overall I do feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this because even through this was real it was in a controlled environment and it helped me to see what would be needed from me in an actual scenario like this</p>
