    <h1>Client Report</h1>
    <p>As the client I decided to use pictures that related to the places I wanted to include in my website</p>
    <p>I mainly communicated with my lead developer during class but we did occasionally communicate through email. There wasnt any issues with communication</p>
    <p>My developer did meet my expectations for my website. He even put some features in the website that I hadnt put in my wireframe but were a good addition to the page.</p>
    <p>Next time I hire a team to do a project for me I will make my expectations clear. I will do better at getting them the things that they need in a timely fashion.</p>
    <p>I currently do not have a link to my page. I have reached out to my lead developer to ask him for it</p>
